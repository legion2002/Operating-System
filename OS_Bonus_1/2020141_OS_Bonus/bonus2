In this case NO deadlock will be present, as philosophers only need one fork to eat and one bowl to eat from.
A deadlock can only arise when all of the philosophers are thinking, and none of them are able to eat.
Since in this case our philosophers have sufficient forks i.e 5, there will always be atleast one philosopher who is eating.

In the worst case scenario atleast 3 philosophers will have the forks according to the distribution - 2+2+1
and the remaining philosophers would have 2 soup bowls
Even in this case the philosophers with the forks would have 2 soup bowls left in the middle which they could eat from.

Thus even in the worst case scenario there would be no deadlock.
